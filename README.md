1st Homework from August 20 for August 22
Hi Class!

44thm0820 here, aka Rey. I'm excited to be in this class, and will try to be prepared as possible.
I like supporting my local sports teams: San Francisco Giants, Oakland A's, San Francisco 49ers, 
Golden State Warriors, and San Jose Sharks!
Talk to you soon!
